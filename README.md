NITI Aayog: Background
NITI Aayog (National Institution for Transforming India) is a policy think tank of the Government of India; it provides strategic inputs to the central and the state governments to achieve various development goals. In the past, NITI Aayog has played an important role in initiatives such as Digital India, Atal Innovation Mission and various agricultural reforms and have designed various policies in education, skill development, water management, healthcare, etc. 

 

NITI Aayog was established to replace the Planning Commission of India, which used to follow a top-down model for policy making, i.e., it typically designed policies at the central level (such as the 5-year plans). On the other hand, NITI Aayog designs policies specific to the different states or segments of the economy.

 

Finance Minister, Arun Jaitley, made the following observation on the necessity of creating NITI Aayog, "The 65-year-old Planning Commission had become a redundant organisation. It was relevant in a command economy structure, but not any longer. India is a diversified country and its states are in various phases of economic development along with their own strengths and weaknesses. In this context, a ‘one size fits all’ approach to economic planning is obsolete...".

Data
The data is sourced from https://data.gov.in/, an Open Government Data (OGD) platform of India. The download instructions are provided in the next segment. The data for GDP analysis of the Indian states is divided into two parts:

Data I-A: This dataset consists of the GSDP (Gross State Domestic Product) data for the states and union territories.

Data I-B: This dataset contains the distribution of GSDP among three sectors: the primary sector (agriculture), the secondary sector (industry) and the tertiary sector (services) along with taxes and subsidies. There is separate dataset for each of the states. You are expected to read the dataset for the available states and join these (in Python) if needed.
